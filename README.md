# 4.06-Unit-Project-TicTacToe

Using Python, students will create a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project has two parts:
1. Designing a game so that two users can play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other.
2. Writing functions which will check the board to see if Xs or Os have won the game or if it ends in a draw.

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which one player draws X's and another player draws O's inside a set of nine squares and each player tries to be the first to fill a row, column, or diagonal of squares with either X's or O's. We will be writing an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe program. At the end of each turn the computer will check to see if X's have won the game or if the O's have won the game.

### Behavior

* Use variables to store the user names for personalized prompts.
* Create a game board represented as a list of lists, size 3 by 3. 
* The program will prompt the user to enter their name and their opponents name. 
* Whoever enters their name first will be playing as X's, and the other player will be O's. 
* The players will take turns inputting the row and column they would like to place their mark. 
* If that spot is already taken the program will ask for the spot again. 
* At the end of each player's turn the program will check if that player has won.
* At the end of each player's turn the program will print the updated game board.
* If there are no more spots open and nobody has won the game, the program will print Tie game!

### Implementation Details

* Check for a winner horizontally, vertically, and on both diagonals.
* Cannot allow a user to overwrite a spot on the board.
